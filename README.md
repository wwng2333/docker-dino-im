# docker-dino-im
This project implements a Docker container for dino-im based on [docker-baseimage-gui](https://github.com/jlesage/docker-baseimage-gui).

The GUI of the application is accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed on the client side) or via any VNC client.
